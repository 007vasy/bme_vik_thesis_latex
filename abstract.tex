The purpose of my thesis is to examine various existing methods of data science in detail, and beside studying its benefits, to develop data-based proactive maintenance methods from them for industrial devices, tools, and machines.

In case of this thesis two data sets have to be preprocessed, analyzed, and with that information, two proactive maintenance methods have to be designed, implemented, and verified.

For educational and research purposes I used two technologies (R,Python) to reach these ambitious objectives, to implement various data processing and analyzing methods, borrowed from statistical or data science field. Armed with that knowledge I came up with special processes helping to indicate to indicate various types of failures in the examined machines and applications.
