The purpose of my thesis is to describe various methods of data science in detail and beside studying its benefits, to develop data-based proactive maintenance methods for industrial devices, tools and machines.

In case of this thesis, two data sets have to be preprocessed, analyzed and with that information, two proactive maintenance methods have to be designed, implemented and verified.

For educational and research purposes I used two technologies (R,Python) to reach these ambitious objectives and implemented various data processing and analyzing methods, borrowed from the statistical or data science field. Armed with that knowledge I came up with special processes that helps to indicate various type of failures in the examined machines and applications.
