The purpose of my thesis is studying data science in detail and beside studying its benefits, to develop data-based proactive maintenance methods for industrial devices, tools and machines.

In case of this thesis, two dataset has to be preprocessed, analyzed and with that information, two proactive maintenance method has to be designed, implemented and verified.

For educational and research purposes I used two technologies (R,Python) to reach these ambitious objectives and implemented various data processing and analyzing methods, borrowed from the statistical or data science field. Armed with that knowledge I come up with special processes to help to indicate various type of failure in the examined machines and applications.
