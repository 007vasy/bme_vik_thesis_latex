\section{Environment of data sets}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The interconnectivity and interoperability \cite{TalebArchInsSys} of sensors and actuators are transforming our environment, and have an enormous effects on the industry as well. Furthermore, we use more and more sensors, and connect them to each other and to computers in order to collect useful data and make predictions.

In this thesis I have developed several prediction methods for proactive maintenance to diminish human and financial resources.

The information I had received to work with is a CAN(Controller Area Network)-Bus data collected from the STILL company's forklifts.

My main task was to prototype methods and to reason for specific data types in order to receive better results developing the Industry 4.0 \cite{Indfourpointzero} MANTIS project further \cite{PaliHCsCPS,HCsCPS2,GartnerIoT,HuangCPS,PaliCPS,HCsCPS,ProMain}.

To achieve this object, I have worked with two kinds of data sets. These will be described in the following sections.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Datasets and objectives}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \subsection{CAN fingerprint data set}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\noindent
My first task was to create a tidy format from the given "CAN fingerprint" data set with cleaning methods. Exploring what can be predicted without provided target value \hyphenation{improves} the identification of requirements for better prognostication. Furthermore visualize the connection between the given variables. Moreover with the second phase data wave and small amount and low resolution target value I made a pilot prediction algorithm to iterate the ultimate solution searching process. 
\noindent
After a few iteration the calculation of the remaining useful life of the tires are achievable.

  \subsection{Electrical fail prediction data set}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph\noindent
The objective is with this data set to come up with a calculation method to compute the remaining useful life, but due to the data is represented in a different way, there is an obvious of the need for a distinct approach.
\paragraph\noindent
Under the influence of the L. Barabasi-Albert book \cite{BALNWSCBOOK}, the RUL computation algorithm is based on the graph visualization of available data. 
\paragraph\noindent
The representation is based on the idea of the possible states' realization as nodes and the machines' paths between the states in time as edges.
\paragraph\noindent
With the previously described data representation, the possibility to go into a specific fail state\footnote{one type of the nodes, the other is the warning states.} with a given timespan is calculable and that is the RUL itself.
