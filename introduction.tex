In this thesis i would like to develop some future predicting method for proactive maintenance, to cut down human and financial cost.

The data what i have get to work with is a CAN-Bus data from STILL Company caterpillars. My main task is to prototype method and reason for specific data types for better results.


My solution: 

Can Fingerprint

Fault prediction
