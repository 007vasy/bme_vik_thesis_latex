	\section{The MANTIS project}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\subsection{Overall picture about MANTIS project}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The MANTIS pilot project is a data-driven decision making system. The collected information comes from industrial sensors. Through a popular IoT communication protocol (MQTT) communicate with given company cloud service where data clarification and prediction happens. These processes are providing future insights to the company's employees for pre-maintenance leading to potential reduction of human, financial, and material resources.\cite{Mantis}

		\subsection{Data sets from STILL}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\subsubsection{CAN fingerprint dataset}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
				\paragraph{Phase One}
				\noindent
As it was mentioned before, STILL forklifts \cite{RX20} use the CAN technology to collect data. In this project two kinds of them are utilized \footnote{Physical sensory and internal electric part logs.}. In one of the two called CAN fingerprint data set, the workers from the STILL had connected a special CAN bus data collector to one forklift and had done with them specific tasks. They have called them "fingerprints". The *.mat file names helped to understand the type of path and what the forklift has gone through:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item {800hTestDrive\_fast.mat}
    \item {800hTestDrive\_slow.mat}
    \item {FastTrack800h\_fast.mat}
 	\item {FastTrack800h\_slow.mat}
	\item {FastTrackEight\_wl\_fast.mat}
	\item {FastTrackEight\_wl\_slow.mat}
	\item {FastTrackEight\_wol\_fast.mat}
	\item {FastTrackEight\_wol\_slow.mat}
  	\item {FastTrackOval\_wl\_fast.mat}
	\item {FastTrackOval\_wl\_slow.mat}
	\item {FastTrackOval\_wol\_fast.mat}
	\item {FastTrackOval\_wol\_slow.mat}
	\item {Ramp\_wl\_fast.mat} 
	\item {Ramp\_wl\_slow.mat}
	\item {Ramp\_wol\_fast.mat}
	\item {Ramp\_wol\_slow.mat}
    \item {WorkCycle\_fast.mat}
    \item {WorkCycle\_slow.mat}
	\item {Shunt800h\_fast.mat}  	
  	\item {Shunt800h\_slow.mat}
 	\item {Shunt\_fast.mat} 	
 	\item {Shunt\_slow.mat}
\end{itemize}\footnote{tracktype\_(with load)/(without load)\_speed}

				\subparagraph\noindent
As it easily can be seen in the file names, the workers carried out various tests with the trucks more than one time with various speed and load on over various tracks.

However, in this first iteration, STILL did not provide any target value for tire abrasion. Thus from this first iteration I was able to make only exploratory data analysis to fuel further data collection. With enough target values in adequate resolution and quality predictive models can be trained based on that data.
				\subparagraph\noindent
In the second iteration on data provided on 10.2017 I received more information in a quite similar fashion, but from working forklifts and a top on that with some additional tire measurement. The CAN-bus sensor data contain approximately two months in time, but there were just a few measurements for tire wear from every third week. Unfortunately, this is just nearly sufficient to make predictions, but required for further iterations to develop and upgrade the model.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
				\paragraph{Phase Two}
In the second iteration our team was given some additional data from STILL. It included 3 forklifts' CAN bus data with additional tire measurements and a little change in the columns names and values.
				\subparagraph\noindent
With this few tire measurement divided in time the interpolation and the RUL calculation become possible, despite of high risk of over-fitting the machine learning model or a statistical model, which could cause the lack of satisfying results.

\#TODO enumerate column names in English.

			\subsubsection{Electrical fail prediction dataset}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\paragraph\noindent
The STILL forklift's system has an electrical CAN bus warning collection subsystem. The warning comes from the part which can communicate with the bus. Engineers of STILL captured this data in a defined time frame and saved it for us in a txt file. 

\paragraph\noindent
One observation in the previously mentioned file involves a forklift unique ID, time stamp, occurred warning and other specific data what isn't in the scope of this thesis.

\paragraph\noindent
In the world of Electrical fail prediction dataset there are two additional file to work with, one is an SAP database export in a txt format and other one is and xls file all two have truck ID, exchanged part ID, and time stamp in one observation along with additional information what is not in the spectrum of this project.

\paragraph\noindent
For the sake of completeness the last two files have technical worker comments and not all observations have exchanged part ID. For that we can use some Natural Language Processing Methods but this is also not in the scope of this piece of writing.

\paragraph\noindent
From this three previously described file when it's represented in a normally workable way, the wanted remaining useful life can be calculated.

\#TODO enumerate column names in English.

	\section{Data processing methods}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\subsection{CAN fingerprint}
				\paragraph\noindent
Assuming someone wants to make educated guess about the future, the neat arrangement of data is demanded, often called tidy format, as it is advised and required for preparation for most of data mining methods. And for that reasons I had chosen the R language to tackle this objective.
				\paragraph\noindent
In this case, the *.mat files involved a special treatment called box-shorting to achieve the clean and usable tidy state. During the box-shorting procedure mentioned before the researcher has to know the range of shorting key (in this data set's case the time stamp key's range) and with that one can make a large data table with a lot of "NA"-s, but it's needed to organize the multi-frequency sensory data.

Once the tidying is done, the \textit{exploratory} data analysis comes to make sense about the data mass and develop ways to achieve the best prediction possible, and short out unnecessary columns to make the future process faster.
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\subsection{Electrical fail prediction}
For knowledge broadation and easy network-like data representation I had chosen Python language, and the Pycharm software \cite{PyCharm} along with NetworkX Python package\cite{NetworkX}.

This is an another coding language useful for data science related to making solutions along with an enormous web community.

	\section{Developing tools}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\subsection{Hardware}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\subsubsection{Personal computer}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
My PC is a Dell Latitude E6320 64 bit with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-2520M CPU @ 2.50GHz processor.
\cite{Latitude}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\subsubsection{Department Linux R and Python server}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department's super computer called "batman" is Linux based R and Python server and it's capable of running R and Python script's on enormous data set's. It has two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 v2 @ 2.10GHz processors, each of them has 6 cores and is capable of running 12 Threads.
\cite{Batman}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		\subsection{Software}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\subsubsection{Linux Ubuntu 17.04}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The operation system in the title is an open source software, stable and convenient for an advanced user, and to go further, it's the easiest way to communicate with to Linux system via SSH.
\cite{Ubuntu}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------				
			\subsubsection{RStudio}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RStudio is the most common tool for developing R projects, it has good package controlling application.
\cite{RStudio}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------	
			\subsubsection{Termius Android mobile phone application}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tidying and data preprocessing method is resource and time consuming. Thus I have optimized it for every-day life with an application via 4G or HSDPA internet access to maintain an SSH connection to the Linux R server. In addition, supervise and check the process's progress from time to time and hand the occasional errors and bugs.
\cite{Termius}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\subsubsection{Git and GitHub}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a consequence of version control and open source commitment I had chosen this common tool set to save my work as it has been progressing.
\cite{Github}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
			\subsubsection{PyCharm}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
At working with the Electrical fail prediction data set, I had used python for various reasons, mainly because there is a package called \textit{NetworkX} \cite{NetworkX}. Moreover, for python developing for me the most convenient tool is PyCharm because it's high functionality.

		\subsection{Management}
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------
according my demand of productivity, I use the GTD\cite{GTD} methodology concluded from 10 years of experience. It provides clarity, focus and flexible planning for me. Additionally, I implemented it in Wrike \cite{WRIKE} project management software available free for students.
